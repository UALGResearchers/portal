## AI Empowered Research: Best Practices to use AI as a Tool to Enhance Postgraduate Research Efficiency

Summary | The application of generative AI tools in postgraduate research projects offers a multifaceted approach to enhancing both the quality and efficiency of research outputs from Masters and PhD students. By adopting best practices in the usage of these tools, postgraduate students can leverage the full potential of AI to streamline their workflows: from relevant literature discovery; to administrative tasks (e.g. grammar correction, template generation for reports, reducing word count for grants, writing letters for journal editors ...); and complex data analysis (e.g. expedite programming, summarization of long texts), among others. This brief communication advocates for the integration of AI into postgraduate research methodologies, emphasizing their role in fostering a more productive and innovative postgraduate research environment.

Speaker | Isabel Duarte, Cancer Genomics Researcher from CINTESIS UAlg
