    "section": "",
    "text": "Today the UAlg Researchers Community met with the Rector and Vice-Rector for Research and Culture to discuss the FCT-Tenure implementation at UAlg. Fifteen questions were sent beforehand to guide our meeting. The meeting details are narrated in the following document (link here). The take home messages are the following:\n\n1. How many applications to the FCT Tenure program does UAlg plan to submit?\nThere can only be a single application per institution per edition of the FCT-Tenure.\n2. How many positions are planned per research center?\nResearch centers will propose how many positions they would like to host, showing their willingness to cover the expenses.\n3. Please indicate clearly and objectively the criteria that will guide the determination of the scientific area/theme and the number of applications per research center.\nThe centers themselves should determine these criteria and report to the Reitoria, which will then validate and integrate all requests from all centers.\n4. How will applications be distributed between research and teaching positions?\nResearch positions will be determined by the research centers in alignment with their strategic objectives and requirements. Teaching positions, on the other hand, will be suggested by the Organic Units in collaboration with the centers, based on teaching needs, and will be financed by UAlg to avoid overburdening the centers.\n5. From the perspective of the Rector’s office, which types of researcher contracts at UAlg are eligible for the FCT-Tenure program?\nThe Rector says that all researchers are eligible. When defining the profile of the candidates, the centers will condition who can be hired. However, UAlg is most concerned with those who are finishing their contracts, i.e. the 2 large groups from the transitional norm (NT) contracts signed in October 2018 and in February 2019.\n6. What percentage of salary payments does UAlg plan to request from research centers?\nIn the first three years, the university will support the centers with 50% of the 1/3 that the institution must co-pay [meaning 1/6 of the total salary].\n7. In the event of a delay in the FCT-Tenure program, is there a contingency plan for research contracts that may end in the meantime?\nUAlg’s action on researcher contracts ending in October 2024 depends on the outcomes of their applications, with no current guarantees of extension, but those ending soon may get hiring priority if their profiles match future opportunities.\n8. The total number of fixed-term research contracts, including their respective end dates.\nThese data has been sent by the Vice-Rector, and is available in the shared spreasdsheet.\n9. Data on the number of teaching hours carried out by researchers, as well as the number of master’s and doctoral students supervised/co-supervised by researchers.\nIn 2023, researchers contributed more than 2500 teaching hours to the UAlg’s Organic Units. More detailed data has been sent by the Vice-Rector, and is available in the shared spreasdsheet.\n10. Official data related to the number of faculty retirements anticipated over the next six years.\n60 retirements are estimated in the coming years.\n11. and 12. We request that the Rectory present its perspective regarding the proposal made by CRUP (…)\nThe Rector states that the only official document that is being considered is the FCT tenure program.\n13. and 14. As researchers at UAlg, […] how can we actively participate in the decision-making that will lead to the application for the FCT-Tenure?\nThe questions were not specifically answered.\n15. We request more information about UAlg’s strategy for the next 5 to 10 years regarding investment in research facilities and strengthening of installed capacity.\nIn the short term there are no plans for investing in new infrastructure for research. Some re-organization of current builds may happen in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "The UAlg Researchers Community proposal title STELLAR is up for voting to win 25000 EUR from the Orçamento Participativo UAlg.\n\nSTELLAR Promotional Video\n\n\n\nBrief proposal’s description.\nAcademia thrives in strong scientific environments. However, researchers, faculty, and students require support in navigating the growing challenges inherent to science, including:\n\nAddressing the rapid advancements in technical and scientific domains, such as the emergence of generative language models like ChatGPT, the introduction of new technologies and analytical methods, and even the evolving European directives concerning data management and personal data.\nManaging well-being and work-life balance, given the escalating competition for consistently limited resources.\nMonetizing scientific knowledge, through patents and intellectual property, remains a relatively underdeveloped area that necessitates a restructuring of research publication and appropriate training, aiming to make scientific research more sustainable and less reliant on constrained resources.\nThe existence of communities dedicated to supporting scientific activities is an internationally recognized reality, well-established in academies with significant scientific impact.\n\nThis proposal for a personal growth and scientific development program seeks to establish a comprehensive and attractive lifelong training ecosystem at UAlg. Its goals include enhancing the capabilities of current academy members and attracting new talent. This initiative represents a clear investment in the future of science, positioning UAlg as an institution that openly supports scientific research, inviting individuals to study where excellence in science is fostered.\n\n\n\nInfographic submited with the proposal.
