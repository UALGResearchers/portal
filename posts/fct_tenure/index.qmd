Today the UAlg Researchers Community met with the Rector and Vice-Rector for Research and Culture to discuss the FCT-Tenure implementation at UAlg. Fifteen questions were sent beforehand to guide our meeting. The meeting details are narrated in the following document (link here). The take home messages are the following:

-   **1. How many applications to the FCT Tenure program does UAlg plan to submit?**\
    There can only be a single application per institution per edition of the FCT-Tenure.

-   **2. How many positions are planned per research center?**\
    Research centers will propose how many positions they would like to host, showing their willingness to cover the expenses.

-   **3. Please indicate clearly and objectively the criteria that will guide the determination of the scientific area/theme and the number of applications per research center.**\
    The centers themselves should determine these criteria and report to the *Reitoria*, which will then validate and integrate all requests from all centers.

-   **4. How will applications be distributed between research and teaching positions?**\
    Research positions will be determined by the research centers in alignment with their strategic objectives and requirements. Teaching positions, on the other hand, will be suggested by the Organic Units in collaboration with the centers, based on teaching needs, and will be financed by UAlg to avoid overburdening the centers.

-   **5. From the perspective of the Rector's office, which types of researcher contracts at UAlg are eligible for the FCT-Tenure program?**\
    The Rector says that all researchers are eligible. When defining the profile of the candidates, the centers will condition who can be hired. However, UAlg is most concerned with those who are finishing their contracts, i.e. the 2 large groups from the transitional norm (NT) contracts signed in October 2018 and in February 2019.

-   **6. What percentage of salary payments does UAlg plan to request from research centers?**\
    In the first three years, the university will support the centers with 50% of the 1/3 that the institution must co-pay \[meaning 1/6 of the total salary\].

-   **7. In the event of a delay in the FCT-Tenure program, is there a contingency plan for research contracts that may end in the meantime?**\
    UAlg's action on researcher contracts ending in October 2024 depends on the outcomes of their applications, with no current guarantees of extension, but those ending soon may get hiring priority if their profiles match future opportunities.

-   **8. The total number of fixed-term research contracts, including their respective end dates.**\
    *These data has been sent by the Vice-Rector, and is available in the shared spreasdsheet.*

-   **9. Data on the number of teaching hours carried out by researchers, as well as the number of master's and doctoral students supervised/co-supervised by researchers.**\
    In 2023, researchers contributed more than 2500 teaching hours to the UAlg's Organic Units. *More detailed data has been sent by the Vice-Rector, and is available in the shared spreasdsheet.*

-   **10. Official data related to the number of faculty retirements anticipated over the next six years.**\
    60 retirements are estimated in the coming years.

-   **11. and 12. We request that the Rectory present its perspective regarding the proposal made by CRUP (...)**\
    The Rector states that the only official document that is being considered is the FCT tenure program.

-   **13. and 14. As researchers at UAlg, \[...\] how can we actively participate in the decision-making that will lead to the application for the FCT-Tenure?**\
    *The questions were not specifically answered.*

-   **15. We request more information about UAlg's strategy for the next 5 to 10 years regarding investment in research facilities and strengthening of installed capacity.**\
    In the short term there are no plans for investing in new infrastructure for research. Some re-organization of current builds may happen in the near future.
