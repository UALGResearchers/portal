The UAlg Researchers Community proposal title STELLAR is up for voting to win 25000 EUR from the *Orçamento Participativo UAlg*.

This is the proposal's description.

Academia thrives in strong scientific environments. However, researchers, faculty, and students require support in navigating the growing challenges inherent to science, including:

1.  Addressing the **rapid advancements in technical and scientific domains**, such as the emergence of generative language models like ChatGPT, the introduction of new technologies and analytical methods, and even the evolving European directives concerning data management and personal data.

2.  Managing **well-being and work-life balance**, given the escalating competition for consistently limited resources.

3.  **Monetizing scientific knowledge**, through patents and intellectual property, remains a relatively underdeveloped area that necessitates a restructuring of research publication and appropriate training, aiming to make scientific research more sustainable and less reliant on constrained resources.

4.  The existence of **communities dedicated to supporting scientific activities** is an internationally recognized reality, well-established in academies with significant scientific impact.

This proposal for a personal growth and scientific development program seeks to establish a comprehensive and attractive **lifelong training ecosystem at UAlg**. Its goals include enhancing the capabilities of current academy members and attracting new talent. This initiative represents a clear investment in the future of science, positioning UAlg as an institution that openly supports scientific research, inviting individuals to study where excellence in science is fostered.
